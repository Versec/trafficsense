Funf Test Android app
===========

A test application as described in http://code.google.com/p/funf-open-sensing-framework/wiki/WifiScannerTutorial .

If the device has no SD card, some extra steps may be required to access the archived SQLite .db files because the com.example.funftest/ directory is somehow invisible.
One example is to use some file management app to copy them to Downloads/ and access from there.
